                <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; My hobbies in life doing the task in our house not only that playing moba games with friends.
                    In gaming just like Mobile Legends it is  a great way to relax and have fun with my friends. 
                    Reading books help me boost my mind to get more ideas or knowledge. 
                    Watching anime, new movie, and k-dramas is one of my hobby. 
                    In my carrier now that I'm a college student I got a new hobby which is doing this website or some coding. 
                    I enjoyed this a lot because its nice to see my hard work even though its a mind blowing. 
                    These type of hobbies is my stress relievers.
                    Editing also is one I enjoyed a lot because I got a comments on other people that they like it. 
                    Hobbies are need to us for avoiding stress or problems in life.</p>
