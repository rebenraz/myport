                         <h1>Educational Journey</h1>
                         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My educational journey was so interesting and also being the nice person today. From my elementary to college years I built myself better and a consistent student in my educational background. 
                            In my elementary days I am very consistent of learnings after school go home early and discover new knowledge. That's why I developed my knowledge more advance. And also I started developing my skills in drawing.
                            In my highschool days I didn't consistent of getting in top because of gadgets. But I developed my communication skills and also in critical thinking.
                            And now in my college days I enrolled in the course Information Systems but this course is what I want to be. This challenges that I am facing right now is really hard just like on project proposals. But for me I see myself a consistent one when it comes to participating in activities, recitations,
                            and also for finishing early the hands-on activities in computer lab. 
                            Additionally my journey I enjoyed being in this course and I will pursue this to achieve my goal and get my degree.
